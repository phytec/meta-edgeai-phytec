# This uEnv.txt file can contain additional environment settings that you
# want to set in U-Boot at boot time.  This can be simple variables such
# as the serverip or custom variables.  The format of this file is:
#    variable=value
# NOTE: This file will be evaluated after the bootcmd is run and the
#       bootcmd must be set to load this file if it exists (this is the
#       default on all newer U-Boot images.  This also means that some
#       variables such as bootdelay cannot be changed by this file since
#       it is not evaluated until the bootcmd is run.

# Update the Linux hostname based on board_name
# The SK also requires an additional dtbo to boot. Prepend it to name_overlays depending on board_name
